# 🧠 Cognitive Agentic Architecture (CAA) & Arti Agent Stack

**Arti Agent Stack is built on the principles of Cognitive Agentic Architecture (CAA)** — a modular, observable, collaboration-first approach to intelligent system design.  
This repo introduces the CAA philosophy, outlines its 5-layer architecture, and defines the 10 operational principles behind Arti's implementation.



## 🔷 Cognitive Agentic Architecture (CAA)

**CAA is a blueprint, not a framework.**  
It defines what agentic systems *should* be: structured, semantic, observable, and designed for human-AI collaboration.

In a world full of fragile demos and prompt loops, CAA sets the architectural foundation for scalable, production-grade AI systems.



## 🧩 Arti Agent Stack

The **Arti Agent Stack** is our opinionated implementation of CAA — forged through real-world deployment in high-stakes environments.

Built to survive the complexity of enterprise operations, Arti is not just a wrapper around LLM calls. It’s a full-stack execution environment for cognitive agents, with first-class support for versioning, observability, and human oversight.


## What’s Inside

📐 **Architecture**  
The 5-layer model of agentic systems built for scale and safety.

- `layers.md` – Core CAA system layers  
- `principles.md` – 10 foundational design principles  
- `patterns.md` – Architecture patterns (e.g., MoE routing, interrupt-resume)

🧱 **The 5 layers of Arti Agent Stack**  
Concrete modules implementing each layer.

- Context layer → semantic inputs, memory, context building  
- Execution layer → behavior routing, tool interfaces  
- State layer → explicit state contracts, persistence  
- Collaboration layer → HITL/HOTL workflows  
- Observability layer → tracing, replay, evaluation hooks

**The 10 Principles of the Arti Agent Stack**
These are the operational rules that shape how CEA behaves in practice:

- Agent = Fancy Function w/ Side Effects
- Prompt = Versioned Behavior Module
- Context = Typed, Structured Inputs
- Memory = Scoped and Addressable
- Tools = Clear Intent, Predictable Behavior
- State = Typed, Structured, & Persistent
- Execution = Controlled, Observable, Replayable
- Collaboration = First-Class Interface Layer
- Error Handling = Composable, Runtime-aware


## Key Concepts

- **Execution-first AI** – Not chatbots. Not search. Agents that do.
- **Typed prompts and context** – No raw string stitching.
- **Composable behaviors** – One agent, one responsibility.
- **Separation of concerns** – Prompting ≠ tooling ≠ state.
- **Observability by design** – Trace every decision and step.

## 🏗️ The 5 Layers of Agentic Systems

CAA defines five critical architectural layers in any cognitive agent system:

1. (**Execution Layer**)(layers/02-execution-layer.md) (The "Engine Room")
   - **Purpose**: To interact with the outside world. This is the lowest level of the stack.
   - **Components**: Typed API wrappers for tools, secure LLM/LMM call handlers, external system interfaces.
   - **Principle Embodied**: Tools as Contracts, (Python) code execution.
   - Tool contracts and typed APIs  
   - Prompt dispatching and behavior routing  
   - Retry, fallback, and tool orchestration  

2. [**State Layer**](layers/03-state-layer.md) (The "System Memory")
   - **Purpose**: To manage and persist the agent's understanding of the world and its own progress. It sits directly on top of the Execution Layer.
   - **Components**: Structured state contracts, persistent memory (short-term & long-term), checkpointing, and transaction management.
   - **Principle Embodied**: State is Explicit, Memory is Scoped.
   - Structured, persistent agent state  
   - Checkpoints, diffing, and time-aware transitions  
   - Separation between model state and external system state  

3. [**Context Layer**](layers/01-context-layer.md) (The "Agent's Brain")
   - **Purpose**: This is the core logic layer where decisions are made. It consumes State and triggers Execution.
   - **Components**: Context builders (the "what am I looking at?"), behavior routing (the "what should I do next?"), prompt dispatching, task combination, and workflow logic (loops, conditions).
   - **Principle Embodied**: Small, Focused Agents, Explicit Control Flow, Prompt = Code.
   - Typed, structured, and versioned inputs  
   - Ontology-driven interpretation  
   - Short-term memory, long-term memory, and overlays  

4. [**Observability Layer**](layers/05-observability-layer.md) (The "Control Tower")
   - **Purpose**: A cross-cutting layer that provides insight into all other layers. It is not sequential but has hooks into Execution, State, and Behavior.
   - **Components**: Full trace capture, step introspection, evaluation hooks, runtime debugging, and semantic metrics.
   - **Principle Embodied**: Observable Everything, Composable Error Handling.
   - Full trace capture and step introspection  
   - Evaluation hooks and runtime debugging  
   - Replayability and semantic metrics  

5. [**Collaboration Layer**](layers/04-collaboration-layer.md) (The "Human Interface")
   - **Purpose**: The top-level interface that allows humans to interact with, supervise, and override the system.
   - **Components**: Human-in-the-loop/on-the-loop workflows, role-specific UX callbacks, interrupt/resume commands, audit logs.
   - **Principle Embodied**: Human Collaboration by Design.
   - Human-in-the-loop and on-the-loop support  
   - Role-specific UX callbacks  
   - Interrupt/resume workflows and audit logs  


## 🔟 10 Principles of the Arti Agent Stack

These are the design rules that make the Arti Stack robust, modular, and production-ready:

1. [**Small, Focused Agents**](principles/01-small-focused-agents.md)  
   - One agent, one responsibility. Scope tightly.

2. [**Separation of Concerns**](principles/02-sparation-of-concerns.md)
   - Divide prompting, tool logic, memory, context, and execution.  
   - No monoliths. No entangled loops.

3. [**Explicit Control Flow**](principles/03-explicit-control-flow)
   - Execution should be defined, inspectable, and testable — not inferred.

4. [**Structured Context**](principles/04-structured-context.md)
   - No string soup. Use typed, versioned context builders.

5. [**Prompt = Code**](principles/05-prompt-management.md)
   - Prompts are versioned, parameterized, testable, and fallback-safe.

6. [**Tools as Contracts**](principles/06-tools-as-contracts.md)
   - Tools have typed interfaces, clear intent, and predictable side effects.

7. [**Observable Everything**](principles/07-observable-everything.md)
   - Every agent step must be traced, debugged, and explainable.

8. [**State is Explicit**](principles/08-state-is-explicit.md)
   - No loose dicts or memory blobs. Use structured, persistent agent state.

9. [**Composable Error Handling**](principles/09-composable-error-handling.md)
   - Treat failure like a system design concern. Retry, fallback, escalate.

10. [**Human Collaboration by Design**](principles/10-human-collaboration-by-design.md)
   - Support interruption, supervision, review, and override from the start.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Most agent frameworks today are brittle, opaque, and trapped in the demo phase.  
CAA and Arti aim higher — turning agents from toys into systems.

If you're building agents that need to survive contact with reality, start here.

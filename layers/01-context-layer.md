# Layer 1: Context Layer

**Cognitive Agentic Architecture â€” Layer 1 of 5**

Agentic systems begin with contextâ€”but not in the form of brittle prompt strings or ad hoc memory hacks. A robust context layer provides a structured, semantic, and versioned representation of all relevant information.

## Core Responsibilities

### âœ… Typed Input Schemas

Context starts with clear expectations. All inputs must follow defined schemas, allowing for validation, interpretation, and version control. No raw strings, no guesswork.

### ðŸ§± Composable Prompt Modules

Context isnâ€™t monolithic. Break prompts into modular, reusable blocks: role descriptions, task intents, memory snippets, and tool usage guides. Each piece is versioned and testable.

### ðŸ§  Ontology-Driven Roles & Intents

Agents operate more reliably when their context is semantically aligned with the domain. Use an ontology to define roles, intents, and domain-specific structures. This creates a shared language between humans, agents, and systems.

### ðŸ§¬ Memory & Overlays

Split memory into short-term (scratchpad, last tool result, thread context) and long-term (domain knowledge, historical logs, entity state). Overlay additional layers for user personalization or session-specific overrides.

## Why It Matters

Unstructured context is a bottleneck for scaling agent intelligence. It leads to:

* Prompt bloat
* Inconsistent behavior
* Debugging nightmares

A real context layer turns context into software: structured, typed, and version-controlled.

## Summary

**Good context isnâ€™t a prompt. Itâ€™s a data structure.**

Design your agents to reason over structured context the same way youâ€™d build any other intelligent systemâ€”with clarity, composability, and traceability.

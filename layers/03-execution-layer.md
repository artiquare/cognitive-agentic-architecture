# Execution Layer

**Layer 2 of the Arti Agent Stack: Cognitive Agentic Architecture**

The Execution Layer is where an agent’s behavior actually happens. It is the backbone of action within agentic systems, transforming structured inputs and defined context into observable outputs and outcomes — with full determinism and traceability.

- **Purpose**: To interact with the outside world. This is the lowest level of the stack.
- **Components**: Typed API wrappers for tools, secure LLM/LMM call handlers, external system interfaces.
- **Principle Embodied**: Tools as Contracts, (Python) code execution.
- Tool contracts and typed APIs  
- Prompt dispatching and behavior routing  
- Retry, fallback, and tool orchestration  

## Key Characteristics

### 🧩 Typed Tools and Interfaces

All tools are invoked via explicit, typed interfaces. No arbitrary string-based payloads or unstructured calls.

* Each tool contract includes input/output schemas
* Enforced with runtime validation and test coverage
* Enables deterministic behavior and guards against silent failure

### 🧠 Behavior Routing (Mixture of Experts)

Leverage modular agents or logic blocks chosen at runtime based on intent, role, or confidence.

* Intent-based dispatching (e.g., classify → route)
* Supports parallel expert agents for specialized sub-tasks
* Reduces prompt complexity and increases modularity

### 🚀 Prompt Dispatching & Overloading

Agents can dynamically select or overload prompts based on the current context or task type.

* Parameterized prompt templates
* Versioned prompt sets for different behaviors
* Supports fallback logic and layered prompting

### 🔁 Retry Logic, Interrupts, and Typed Side-Effects

All actions are instrumented for resilience.

* Built-in retry and exponential backoff patterns
* Human-interruptible steps with resumable context
* Typed side-effects (logging, storage, notifications) to ensure predictability

## Why It Matters

Most failures in agentic systems occur in the execution layer: ambiguous behavior, untraceable tool calls, or brittle flows. By making behavior explicit, typed, and observable, the execution layer ensures robust, modular, and auditable automation.

> "LLMs may suggest actions, but execution must be treated as software — not a string-based dream."

## Summary

The Execution Layer is where intelligence meets accountability. By enforcing strong contracts and explicit logic, it turns prompts into reliable outcomes — not just guesses.

# State Layer

**Layer 3 of the Arti Agent Stack: Cognitive Agentic Architecture**

State is the backbone of agentic systems — it must be persistent, structured, and explicitly defined. Unlike traditional approaches where state is often hidden in fragile dictionaries or buried in memory blobs, the Cognitive Agentic Architecture mandates clear and testable state transitions.

## Key Characteristics

### 🧠 Persistent, Structured Internal State

Agents should maintain well-defined internal state across executions:

* Use structured types (e.g. Pydantic models) instead of freeform dicts.
* Avoid ephemeral or hard-to-debug memory constructs.
* Persist state when needed to support resumability and collaboration.

### 🔄 Distinct Model vs. Environment State

Separate concerns:

* **Model State**: What the agent believes, tracks, and updates internally.
* **Environment/User State**: Inputs, outputs, and effects from the external world.
  This separation improves reasoning, debugging, and validation.

### ⏮️ Checkpoints, Rewinds, and Transitions

Execution should support defined points of return and resumption:

* Save state before high-risk or complex operations.
* Allow rewind and replay for deterministic testing.
* Transitions between states should be typed and validated.

## Why It Matters

Brittle memory and opaque state management lead to cascading failures, poor observability, and untrustworthy agents. To scale, agents must be able to:

* Restore known-good states.
* Be debugged after errors.
* Handle concurrent, complex workflows.

## Summary

State is not an implementation detail — it’s a core abstraction. Cognitive agents must treat state as a first-class citizen: observable, testable, and persistable.

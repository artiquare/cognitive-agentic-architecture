# Collaboration Layer

**Layer 4 of the Arti Agent Stack: Cognitive Agentic Architecture**

Real-world systems are not autonomous by defaultâ€”theyâ€™re collaborative. The Collaboration Layer is where agents are designed to work *with* humans, not around them. It's not about fallbackâ€”itâ€™s foundational.

## Key Characteristics

### ðŸ›‘ Interrupt / Approve / Resume Hooks

Agent flows must allow for:

* Pausing execution at checkpoints
* Requiring human approval or correction
* Resuming without breaking state or flow

This requires deterministic state, modular control, and robust execution tracing.

### ðŸ§  Role-Aware UX Callbacks

Different users need different interfaces:

* Operators, experts, supervisors, and analysts each interact with the system differently.
* Responses, context, and interfaces must adapt based on roles and responsibility.

Think: "Approval required by a field supervisor" vs. "FYI for a project manager."

### ðŸ§° Operator-Grade Workflows

Forget demo chatbotsâ€”design for operators:

* Task queueing, escalation paths, and audit trails
* Slack, voice, email, or native UI integration
* Interfaces optimized for attention, not entertainment

Agents must fit *into* the workflow, not force new ones.

## Why It Matters

In production systems, autonomy is a privilegeâ€”not a starting point. Trust is earned through visibility, control, and collaboration. If a system canâ€™t pause, explain itself, or be corrected, it wonâ€™t be used when it matters most.

## Summary

Cognitive agents are collaborators. The best systems are designed to fit seamlessly into expert workflowsâ€”augmenting, not replacing, human intelligence.

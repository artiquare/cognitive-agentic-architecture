# Observability & Evaluation Layer

**Layer 5 of the Arti Agent Stack: Cognitive Agentic Architecture**

You can’t trust what you can’t trace. The Observability & Evaluation Layer ensures every agent decision, action, and failure is inspectable — not just during development, but in real-world operations.

- **Purpose**: A cross-cutting layer that provides insight into all other layers. It is not sequential but has hooks into Execution, State, and Behavior.
- **Components**: Full trace capture, step introspection, evaluation hooks, runtime debugging, and semantic metrics.
- **Principle Embodied**: Observable Everything, Composable Error Handling.
- Full trace capture and step introspection  
- Evaluation hooks and runtime debugging  
- Replayability and semantic metrics  

## Key Characteristics

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Execution Traces

Agents must emit structured traces for every execution:

* Inputs, outputs, context windows
* Tool calls, responses, and decision paths
* Errors, fallbacks, retries

This makes debugging, compliance, and optimization possible at scale.

### 🔁 Replay + Introspection

Support deterministic replay of past runs:

* Restore exact inputs, state, and tool outputs
* Introspect where things diverged from expected paths
* Enable regression testing and behavior verification

Replays are a precondition for trust in agentic systems.

### 🧪 Eval Harnesses for Prompts & Tools

Every prompt and tool should be:

* Versioned and evaluated independently
* Tested for regressions across input types and edge cases
* Monitored continuously in production via synthetic probes or shadow evals

Think beyond one-shot benchmarks — focus on workflow integrity.

### 📊 Semantic Metrics (Not Just Tokens)

Token counts are not enough. Measure what matters:

* Task completion success
* Error recovery rates
* Time-to-resolution and collaboration frequency
* Alignment with human judgment and business rules

Build observability into the agent — not around it.

## Why It Matters

Most AI failures aren’t caused by models — they’re caused by systems that can’t be observed, debugged, or trusted under pressure. Without observability, you’re flying blind.

## Summary

The Cognitive Agentic Architecture closes the loop: agents must not only *act*, they must *explain* and *evolve*. Tracing and evaluation aren’t afterthoughts — they’re the foundation of operational trust.

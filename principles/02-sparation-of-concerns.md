# Separation of Concerns

**Principle 2 of the Arti Agent Stack**

---

## Why It Matters

In most agent frameworks today, prompting, tool invocation, context construction, and state handling are jumbled together into monolithic logic. This leads to brittle systems that are hard to debug, extend, or reason about. When an LLM gets something wrong, you donâ€™t know if the prompt failed, the tool output was misinterpreted, or the context was flawed.

Separation of concerns is a foundational principle in classical software engineering. We apply it rigorously to agentic systems to avoid entanglement between the parts of the system that *decide*, *act*, *remember*, and *explain*.

## The Problem in Most Frameworks

* Prompt logic lives inside the agent loop or tool definitions
* Context construction is just string concatenation, often embedded in prompt templates
* Tool logic is co-mingled with the execution control flow
* State is stored in untyped dicts, often modified in arbitrary ways

This makes agent behavior unpredictable, opaque, and nearly impossible to test.

## Our Approach

In the Arti Agent Stack (built on Cognitive Agentic Architecture), each layer is responsible for a **single role**:

### Prompting

* Prompts are defined as reusable, versioned, parameterized modules
* Prompt construction is testable and observable independently

### Context

* Context builders construct typed context objects from live sources (e.g., CRM, ERP, memory)
* The context lifecycle is explicit: constructed, enriched, validated, versioned

### Tooling

* Tools are declared independently with typed input/output contracts
* Tools know nothing about prompts, context, or LLMs

### Execution Logic

* Control flow defines what runs when, using declarative routing or logic trees
* This is where "mixture of experts" logic lives

### Memory / State

* State is maintained separately and explicitly persisted
* It's typed, validated, and passed intentionally, not inferred or mutated implicitly

## Benefits

* **Debuggability**: You can isolate and test prompt behavior, tool results, and control flow separately
* **Reusability**: Prompts, tools, and context modules can be reused across agents
* **Observability**: Logs and traces are interpretable because responsibilities are isolated
* **Resilience**: Failures in one component don't corrupt others
* **Modularity**: Teams can work on tools, prompts, or context modules independently

## Summary

If you want agents that behave reliably under load, scale across use cases, and are maintainable in the long term, separation of concerns is non-negotiable. It's how we move from demo agents to production systems.

# Principle: Explicit Control Flow

## Summary

Agent systems often obscure execution logic within opaque while-loops, recursive LLM calls, or inference-based decision trees. This makes them difficult to debug, extend, or trust. **Explicit control flow** means that your agent's logic is defined like any reliable software system — with clear branching, conditions, and transitions.

## Core Concepts

* **No Hidden Loops:** Avoid architectures where the LLM repeatedly calls itself without explicit boundaries. Instead, loop logic should be defined in code or execution plans.
* **Deterministic Steps:** Each step in the agent's flow should be deterministic, inspectable, and predictable. What happens next should be a product of system logic, not LLM guesswork.
* **Clear Transitions:** If an agent moves from one phase to another (e.g. plan → search → synthesize), those transitions should be explicitly encoded and observable.
* **No Implicit State Changes:** Avoid relying on prompt-wrapped memory or conversational flows to encode control logic. Use proper state machines, task plans, or orchestration engines.

## Implementation Strategies

* Define workflows as **step functions**, **state machines**, or **directed graphs** that are readable and testable.
* Use an **execution context object** to pass state across steps.
* Design tools to **emit structured signals** (e.g., DONE, RETRY, ESCALATE) that inform next steps.
* Keep LLM calls inside scoped modules with defined inputs/outputs.

## Benefits

* **Predictability:** You always know what path the system is on.
* **Testability:** You can write unit tests for specific paths.
* **Debuggability:** You can trace how and why a specific result was reached.
* **Trust:** Stakeholders can reason about system behavior — a must in enterprise or regulated environments.

## Common Pitfalls

* Wrapping loops inside LLM prompts: "What should I do next?" repeated until the agent decides it's done.
* Letting the LLM control its own retries or escalation without system guardrails.
* Not separating planning from execution — mixing tool selection and state transitions into a single LLM step.

## Final Note

If your agent architecture resembles a black box — or worse, a loop with a prayer — it’s not production-grade. **Make execution explicit.** That’s how software scales.

# Principle 7: Observable Everything

In production-grade agentic systems, visibility is non-negotiable. You must be able to **trace, debug, and explain every step** an agent takes. Without full observability, you're flying blind — and when things break, you won't know why.

### Why This Matters

LLM-based systems are inherently probabilistic. They can produce plausible responses that are subtly wrong. Without visibility into intermediate reasoning, context, and execution, debugging failures becomes guesswork.

Observability turns opaque AI behavior into **deterministic execution traces**. It enables:

* Root cause analysis
* Quality control
* Trust and explainability
* Auditing and compliance
* Iterative improvement

### What You Need to Observe

Every agent step must be inspectable. That includes:

#### • What context it had

* The full structured, versioned context at the moment of execution
* Memory state, prompt stack, and environmental parameters

#### • Why it chose a tool

* The decision logic, reasoning trace, and tool selection process
* Any fallback or retry paths it evaluated

#### • What it said vs. what it did

* The raw LLM output vs. the actual tool calls made
* Execution deltas between intent and result

#### • Where it failed

* Any exceptions, timeouts, tool errors, or invalid states
* Which layer or step caused the failure

### Implementation Best Practices

* **Trace IDs**: Tag every agent run and step with a unique trace ID
* **Structured logs**: Capture structured JSON logs for every major event
* **Replayability**: Make it possible to re-run any trace deterministically
* **Separation**: Log context, decisions, execution, and outputs separately
* **Instrumentation hooks**: Allow for custom logging and monitoring at each layer

### Example Tools & Techniques

* Use tracing libraries like OpenTelemetry or Langfuse
* Define a trace schema for all agentic actions
* Build UIs or dashboards for trace inspection and root cause analysis
* Hook into tracing for evaluation, scoring, and monitoring

### Summary

> If you can't observe it, you can't trust it.

Observability isn't a debugging feature — it's a core design requirement for safe, reliable, and scalable agent systems.

**Design your agents like you design software — with full introspection and deterministic traces.**

# Principle 8: State is Explicit

> **No dicts or fragile memory blobs. Use structured, persistent state.**

In too many agent implementations, state is an afterthought. It lives in loose `dict` objects, fragile context strings, or memory hacks bolted onto looped prompts. This is not scalable. It's not inspectable. And it's not safe for anything beyond demos.

In cognitive agentic architecture, **state is a first-class citizen**.

## Why Explicit State Matters

* **Debuggability**: If the system fails, you need to know *what the agent believed* at that point in time. That means structured state, not transient strings or ephemeral memory.

* **Persistence**: Agents may need to pause, resume, retry, or even rewind. You need checkpoints and durable state storage.

* **Interoperability**: External systems (UI, logs, audits, human supervisors) must be able to inspect, modify, or even inject state. That’s impossible with black-box memory blobs.

* **Separation of Concerns**: Execution logic should *depend on* state, not *define or mutate* it invisibly. The state layer defines what the agent knows and how it knows it.

## What Explicit State Looks Like

* Defined as **typed objects or schemas** (e.g. Pydantic, dataclasses)
* Stored in **structured, inspectable formats** (e.g. JSON, serialized schema)
* Designed with **versioning** in mind to handle evolution over time
* Includes separation of:

  * **Agent internal state** (intent, plan, history)
  * **Environment state** (external inputs, retrieved data)
  * **Execution state** (step progress, retry count, errors)

---

## Key Design Recommendations

* Never pass `dict` blobs between steps. Use typed state models.
* Use a checkpointing system to persist agent state at every major transition.
* Track deltas in state explicitly. Don’t mutate state in place without logging.
* If you resume or restart, load from known-good state snapshots.
* Make state part of your observability stack: log it, audit it, and expose it.

## Summary

The cognitive capacity of an agent is only as good as the clarity of its memory. If your agent’s state is a soup of strings and `dict` mutations, your system will collapse under complexity.

> Treat state like any software system treats critical data: explicitly, structurally, and observably.

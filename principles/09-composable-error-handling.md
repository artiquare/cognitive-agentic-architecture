# Principle 9: Composable Error Handling

Agentic systems operate in dynamic, unpredictable environments. Failures are inevitable. What distinguishes a production-grade system is not the absence of errors, but how gracefully and predictably it handles them.

### Why This Matters

In real-world workflows, LLMs will:

* Misunderstand input
* Misuse tools
* Hit rate limits or timeouts
* Fail to complete tasks due to ambiguity

Systems that treat failure as an exception instead of an expected path are brittle by design.

### The Principle

> Handle failures like any software system.
> Retry, fallback, escalate.

Every decision point in an agentic system should be:

* **Interruptible** – Can execution pause safely?
* **Retryable** – Can failure trigger a repeat with modified parameters or context?
* **Fallback-enabled** – Is there a simpler path if the main one fails?
* **Escalatable** – Can a human or supervisor agent step in?

### Examples

* **Tool Failure**: If a tool call times out, retry with exponential backoff. If still failing, use a simpler backup tool. If that fails, ask the user.
* **LLM Uncertainty**: If the LLM returns low-confidence or non-parseable output, rerun with reduced temperature, or fall back to a deterministic step.
* **Agent Confusion**: If the agent cannot determine the next step, route to a human or trigger an audit trail.

### Design Pattern

Use middleware or decorators to wrap every critical function with:

* Retry logic
* Error logging and tracing
* Recovery path selection (fallback or human escalation)

Failures should be first-class citizens, not edge cases. Treat them as a natural branch in your control flow.

### Antipatterns

* Silent retries that hide failure symptoms
* Nested try-catch blocks without structured error semantics
* Blaming the LLM instead of designing for uncertainty

### Summary

Error handling is not a band-aid — it’s a contract. If your agents can’t fail safely, they can’t scale.

> Design your agent stack like an operating system, not a toy demo. Every crash path must have a clear plan.

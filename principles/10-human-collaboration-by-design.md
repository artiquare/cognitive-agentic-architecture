# Human Collaboration by Design

**Principle 10 of the Arti Agent Stack: Cognitive Agentic Architecture**

Agentic systems are not meant to replace humans — they are built to collaborate with them. Real-world environments are noisy, unpredictable, and full of edge cases. This makes seamless human-AI interaction essential, not optional.

## Key Tenets

### 🔄 Interruptible

Agents must allow for manual pause, intervention, or override at any point in the execution. If a human needs to step in, the system should support this with minimal disruption.

* Interrupts are not exceptions—they’re expected.
* Design execution checkpoints that allow for safe pausing.

### ▶️ Resumable

After a human review or modification, agents should be able to resume execution from a known, valid state. This requires persistent state management and version-controlled memory/context.

* No fragile stack traces or ephemeral session state.
* Resume from checkpoints or restore context from logs.

### 🧾 Auditable

Every decision, input, output, and action must be traceable. This is crucial for trust, validation, compliance, and debugging.

* Logs should show what the agent saw, what it chose to do, and why.
* Human decisions and overrides should be recorded as part of the trace.

## Why It Matters

In operations, human expertise doesn’t disappear — it moves up the stack. Agents need to support escalation, approval, and review flows. Systems that assume full autonomy will fail when trust is needed most.

Design for collaboration:

* Supervisor mode
* Editor/reviewer workflows
* Audit trails for all decisions

## Summary

Cognitive automation must be human-compatible. Collaboration isn’t a fallback—it’s a first-class design requirement.

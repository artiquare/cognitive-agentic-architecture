# The 5 Layers of Cognitive Agentic Systems - Product View

## Context Layer

From raw data to structured understanding.
AI needs to understand the task, the user, the environment. This layer builds the right “mental model” from text, data, memory — so the AI can act with context, not guess.

## Execution Layer

Where work gets done.
This is the logic layer. The workflows. The “do this, then that.” It’s where tools are triggered, steps executed, and logic followed. Without this, you just have a chatbot.

## State Layer

Keeps track of what’s going on.
Real work happens over time — with multiple steps, decisions, and tools. This layer remembers the past, tracks the present, and guides the future. No more stateless agents guessing what happened last.

## Collaboration Layer

Humans in the loop, by design.
Sometimes the AI should ask, not act. This layer lets humans approve, guide, or take over. It’s how you make AI safe, auditable, and trusted in real operations.

## Observability Layer

See what the AI is doing — and why.
This layer lets you debug, trace, and evaluate what’s happening. It’s the difference between “I think it worked” and “I know it worked.”

## Reframe the 5 Layers Around The User Problems

| Layer         | Their Pain                             | Our Framing                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Context       | “The AI doesn’t get what I want.”      | Structured context → AI that understands your intent. |
| Execution     | “It chats, but doesn’t do anything.” | Real workflows → actions, not answers.                  |
| State         | “It forgets what just happened.”       | Persistent memory → continuity, not confusion.          |
| Collaboration | “I can’t trust it without reviewing.”  | Human-in-the-loop → approvals, transparency, control.   |
| Observability | “No one knows why it failed.”        | Step-by-step traceability → trust through visibility.   |
